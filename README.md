# Study_Pulse
The "Study Pulse" project is an educational platform designed to help students with tech and skill-based learning. It is primarily built using HTML and CSS, with features like grids, flexbox, and media queries. The project is currently incomplete, requiring additional JavaScript to advance its functionality. Contributors are welcome to enhance the project. The platform aims to provide an accessible learning experience for students, though further development is needed to reach its full potential.
